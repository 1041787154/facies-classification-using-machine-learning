#A Machine Learning Approach to Facies Classification Using Well Logs #

This repository contains the code we developed to solve the facies classification problem described at https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest.
The python notebook showing the achieved results can be visualized also following this [link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/polimi-ispl/facies-classification-using-machine-learning/raw/e469b561d0a997df90f2e6dcf31df2c432fc2303/facies_classification.ipynb).
